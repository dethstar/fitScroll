fitScroll
=========
Most technologic work is done so the user does less. We believe doing less and less will be harmful in the long term, such as in the movie wall-e.
fitScroll is a tool in the works to help those who spend lots of time using a PC involve in greater physical activity.

This will be achieved by using bike pedals to scroll content (be it a book, a document, or a webpage).
It'll let the users define how many times they'll need to push the pedals to achieve a scroll of value 1 or -1.


It's going to be supported in both Windows and Linux.
No support for OS X is planned.
